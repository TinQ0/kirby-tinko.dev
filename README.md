# My personal website, now with more blog and more pictures.

I'm building a new website, this time using [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com).
## The goal
A site, where I can write my thoughts from anywhere (read, mobile and desktop), and where I ~~dump~~ showcase my photos.

This is probably gonna take a while. For now, I'm publishing some little notes over on ghost, but I'm missing some flexibility working over there. 

I hope starting from the plainkit will finally instill some good HTML and CSS practices in me. I want to write a lot of the frontend myself and follow the book regarding accessibility.

## Plugins I want to implement
- [ ] OG Image
- [ ] Kirby Photo stats
- [ ] Kirby Devkit
- [ ] Some Content git sync plugin
  - [ ] With git LFS or something else to handle the images
- [ ] Dark visitors
- [ ] Indieconnector
- [ ] Komments 
- [ ] Matomo
- [ ] HTMLHead, or make sure my <head> content follows best practices
- [ ] Kirby Favicon
- [ ] Some responsive image implementation
- [ ] Feed and Sitemap
- [ ] Locator, but only because it looks cool
